# श्रीमद्वाल्मीकीयरामायणम् (Ṣrīmadvālmīkīya*rāmāyaṇam*)

**[श्रीमद्रामायणस्य पठनम्](https://lipi-parivartan.vercel.app)**

This Project is an effort to provide the text of the Valmiki Ramayanam in a structured format. The text is fetched from the [Valmiki Ramayanam - Wikisource](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/रामायणम्) crosschecking from the Book [`ShrimadValmikiRamayanam by R.Narayanaswamy`](https://archive.org/details/361952998SrimadValmikiRamayanaSanskrit1933AD/page/n5/mode/2up) and processed to provide the text in various formats.

We also aim to provide Translations and _Transliterations_ of the text in various languages.
