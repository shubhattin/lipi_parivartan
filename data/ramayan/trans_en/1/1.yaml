  And now, the 1st chapter in the Childhood Section
  of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Narada's Narration'.
1: >
  Maharishi Valmiki, the great ascetic, asked Narada, who is engaged in the Vedas, penance, and studies, who is the best of the eloquent orators, thus...
2: >
  “Who, in this present world, is endowed with virtues? Who is courageous, who is knowledgeable in dharma, and who is full of gratitude? Who speaks the truth, and is firm in his vows?
3: >
  Who is endowed with good conduct? Who has the welfare of all beings in mind? Who is learned, capable, and who is pleasing to look at?
4: >
  Who is self-controlled, who has conquered anger, who is radiant, and who is free from envy? Whom do the gods themselves fear in battle, when his wrath is kindled?”
5: >
  “I wish to hear of such a man, for my curiosity is intense. O great sage, you are capable of knowing such a person.”
6: >
  Upon hearing these words of Valmiki, Narada, who knew the three worlds, joyfully spoke these words, starting with “Listen...”
7: >
  “O sage, the qualities you have mentioned are indeed many and rare. After considering them, I will tell you of a man who possesses them. Hear me now!”
8: >
  “There is a man known by the name of Rama, born in the Ikshvaku dynasty. He is self-restrained, immensely powerful, radiant, resolute, and self-controlled.
9: >
  He is wise, virtuous, eloquent, illustrious, and a destroyer of foes. His shoulders are broad, his arms long, his neck conch-shaped, and his jaws wide-set.
10: >
  He has a large chest, is an expert archer, has deep collar bones, and is the subduer of enemies. His arms rest on his knees when seated, his head is well-formed, his forehead is broad, and he is of great prowess.”
11: >
  He is symmetrical in form, with well-proportioned limbs, a smooth complexion, and a gentle glow. His chest is broad, his eyes are large, and he is endowed with Lakshmi (prosperity) and auspicious marks.
12: >
  He knows dharma, is truthful in his promises, and is devoted to the welfare of his people. He is renowned, full of knowledge, pure, self-controlled, and focused in meditation.
13: >
  He is like Prajapati (the creator) in majesty, and like Dhata (the sustainer) in power, destroying enemies. He protects all living beings and safeguards the principles of dharma.
14: >
  He is the protector of his own dharma and the protector of his own people. He is an expert in the Vedas and their branches, and highly skilled in the art of archery.
15: >
  He knows the essence of all scriptures, is mindful and has great intellect. He is beloved by all people, virtuous, compassionate, and highly discerning.
16: >
  He is constantly sought after by the virtuous, just as rivers seek the ocean. He treats everyone equally, is noble, and always pleasing to the eyes.
17: >
  Endowed with all virtues, he is the delight of Kausalya. In depth, he is like the ocean, and in patience, like the Himalayas.
18: >
  In valor, he is like Vishnu, and as charming as the moon. In anger, he is like the fire of destruction, and in forgiveness, he is like the earth.
19: >
  In generosity, he is like Kubera, and in truth, he is like Dharma personified. Such is Rama, full of all these virtues and truth in action.
20: >
  The eldest son of King Dasharatha, who is endowed with the best of qualities, is beloved by the people. He is always engaged in the welfare of the citizens and is loved for his noble intentions.
21: >
  With affection, King Dasharatha desired to appoint Rama as the heir apparent (Yuvraja). However, upon seeing the preparations for the coronation, Queen Kaikeyi intervened.
22: >
  The queen, who had been granted two boons earlier, demanded those boons: the exile of Rama, and the coronation of Bharata.
23: >
  Bound by his promise and the bonds of dharma, King Dasharatha, though grieved, exiled his beloved son Rama.
24: >
  Rama, the valiant one, adhering to his vow, departed to the forest in obedience to his father's words and to fulfill the wishes of Kaikeyi.
25: >
  Out of love and respect, his devoted younger brother Lakshmana, the joy of Sumitra, followed Rama, showcasing his brotherly affection.
26: >
  Sita, Rama's beloved wife, who was always dear to him and like his life itself, accompanied him as well.
27: >
  Born in the family of King Janaka and created as if by divine power, she was perfect in all virtues and was the best of all women.
28: >
  Sita followed Rama just as Rohini follows the moon. They were accompanied for a long distance by the citizens and also by King Dasharatha.
29: >
  At Shringaverapura, on the banks of the Ganga, Rama dismissed his charioteer Sumantra and met Guha, the virtuous chief of the Nishadas, who was dear to him.
30: >
  Rama, along with Lakshmana, Sita, and Guha, crossed many rivers and proceeded deeper into the forest.
31: >
  Following the instructions of sage Bharadwaja, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita arrived at Chitrakoota. They made a beautiful dwelling there and enjoyed living in the forest together.
32: >
  Resembling gods and Gandharvas in their appearance, the three of them lived happily in Chitrakoota. Meanwhile, back in Ayodhya, King Dasharatha, tormented by grief for his son, passed away, mourning Rama.
33: >
  After King Dasharatha’s departure, the great and powerful Bharata, though urged by Vasishta and other sages to take up the kingdom, did not desire to rule.
34: >
  The valiant Bharata, desiring only to show respect to Rama’s feet, went to the forest to meet his noble brother.
35: >
  Upon reaching the great and truthful Rama, Bharata, placing honor and respect before him, entreated his elder brother to return.
36: >
  With words of righteousness, Bharata said, "You alone are the rightful king." However, the exceedingly noble and gracious Rama, who was of great fame, did not accept the kingdom due to his father’s command.
37: >
  Instead, Rama, the mighty one, repeatedly gave Bharata his sandals as a symbol of ruling in his place, instructing him to govern the kingdom with the sandals as the regent.
38: >
  Unsuccessful in his desire to bring back Rama, Bharata, touching Rama’s feet in reverence, returned to Ayodhya.
39: >
  Back in Nandigrama, Bharata governed the kingdom, always awaiting Rama’s return.
40: >
  After Bharata’s departure, Rama, the noble and self-restrained one, seeing the gathering of citizens at Chitrakoota, decided to enter the Dandaka forest with single-minded focus.
41: >
  Entering the great forest, Rama, the lotus-eyed one, killed the demon Viradha and then met the sage Sharabhanga.
42: >
  He also met the sages Sutikshna, Agastya, and Agastya’s brother. As per Agastya’s instruction, Rama joyfully received the divine bow of Indra.
43: >
  Along with the bow, he also received a sword and two quivers that never ran out of arrows. Living in the forest with the forest dwellers, Rama was visited by all the rishis.

44: >
  The rishis approached Rama, seeking protection from the demons and rakshasas who were tormenting them in the forest.

45: >
  Rama promised the rishis, who lived in Dandaka forest and were as radiant as fire, that he would destroy the rakshasas in battle.

46: >
  While residing in the forest, a rakshasi (demoness) named Shurpanakha, who could change her form at will, approached Rama and was disfigured by him.

47: >
  Incited by Shurpanakha’s words, the rakshasas Khara, Trishiras, and Dushana, along with their forces, prepared for battle against Rama.

48: >
  In that battle, Rama destroyed Khara, Trishiras, Dushana, and their entire army. In total, fourteen thousand rakshasas were slain in the forest of Janasthana.

49: >
  When Ravana, the king of the rakshasas, heard of the slaughter of his kinsmen, he was consumed by rage.

50: >
  Seeking assistance, Ravana approached the rakshasa Maricha. Though Maricha tried to dissuade him many times, Ravana persisted.

51: >
  "Do not oppose a powerful one, O Ravana. It is not wise for you." However, disregarding this advice, Ravana, driven by fate, proceeded.

52: >
  Accompanied by Maricha, Ravana reached Rama's hermitage. Using Maricha’s illusion, he lured the two princes away from the hermitage.

53: >
  He then abducted Rama’s wife, Sita, after killing the vulture Jatayu, who had tried to protect her.

54: >
  Seeing the slain Jatayu and learning that Sita had been abducted, Rama, overwhelmed by sorrow, lamented with his senses in disarray.

55: >
  Then, consumed by grief, Rama cremated Jatayu. While searching the forest for Sita, he encountered a terrifying rakshasa named Kabandha, deformed in appearance.

56: >
  Rama, the mighty-armed one, killed the rakshasa and sent him to the heavens. Before departing, Kabandha advised Rama to visit Shabari, a pious and righteous ascetic.

57: >
  Following this advice, the mighty Rama, the destroyer of enemies, approached Shabari.

58: >
  Shabari, a devoted ascetic, duly worshiped Rama, the son of Dasharatha. On the banks of the Pampa River, Rama met the Vanara Hanuman.

59: >
  At Hanuman's suggestion, Rama met Sugriva. Rama narrated the entire story to Sugriva, detailing the events, especially regarding Sita’s abduction.

60: >
  After hearing everything from Rama, the Vanara king Sugriva listened attentively to the entire account.

61: >
  Rama, pleased with Sugriva, made a pact of friendship with him, witnessed by fire (Agni) as the witness.

62: >
  Then, Sugriva, the king of the Vanaras, narrated his story of enmity with Vali to Rama with affection and sorrow. Rama promised to kill Vali in response.

63: >
  Sugriva also explained Vali's immense strength. However, Sugriva doubted Rama's strength and was constantly uncertain about Rama's ability.

64: >
  To prove his strength to Sugriva, Rama saw and then smiled as Sugriva showed him the enormous body of Dundubhi, which resembled a massive mountain.

65: >
  The mighty-armed Rama, with a smile, used his big toe to hurl the entire body of Dundubhi ten yojanas (miles).

66: >
  Next, Rama shot a single arrow that pierced through seven sala trees, the mountain, and even into the netherworld, thus reassuring Sugriva.

67: >
  With his heart now filled with joy and trust in Rama, the great Vanara, Sugriva, went with Rama to the cave of Kishkindha.

68: >
  There, Sugriva, the golden-hued king of the Vanaras, let out a tremendous roar. Hearing this thunderous sound, Vali, the lord of the Vanaras, came out.

69: >
  After consulting Tara, Vali engaged in battle with Sugriva. During the fight, Rama killed Vali with a single arrow.

70: >
  After Vali was slain, Rama, as per Sugriva’s request, restored the kingdom to Sugriva, making him the king of Kishkindha.


71: >
  Sugriva, the best of the Vanaras, gathered all the Vanaras and sent them in different directions, eager to search for Janaka’s daughter, Sita.

72: >
  Then, based on the words of the vulture Sampati, the powerful Hanuman leaped across the vast ocean, which was a hundred yojanas (miles) wide.

73: >
  Reaching Lanka, the city ruled by Ravana, Hanuman found Sita, who was deep in thought, in the Ashoka grove.

74: >
  After giving her Rama’s token of recognition and conveying all the news, he consoled the grieving Vaidehi (Sita) and then proceeded to destroy the gateway.

75: >
  He killed the five foremost leaders of the army, the seven sons of ministers, and crushed the valiant Aksha. Eventually, he allowed himself to be captured.

76: >
  Realizing that he was invulnerable to weapons due to the boon granted by Brahma, the brave Hanuman calmly tolerated the rakshasas who bound him.

77: >
  After setting Lanka ablaze, except for the place where Maithili (Sita) was, the great Vanara returned to deliver good news to Rama.

78: >
  Approaching the noble Rama and circumambulating him, the selfless Hanuman reported truthfully, "I have seen Sita."

79: >
  Then, along with Sugriva, Rama reached the shores of the vast ocean and, with arrows as radiant as the sun, began to stir the waters.

80: >
  The ocean, the lord of rivers, appeared before Rama and, following the ocean’s advice, Rama ordered Nala to construct a bridge across the waters.


81: >
  Having reached the city of Lanka and killing Ravana in battle, Rama regained Sita, but then he was overtaken by intense doubt and embarrassment.

82: >
  In the presence of the public, Rama spoke harsh words to Sita. Unable to bear this accusation, the virtuous Sita entered the blazing fire.

83: >
  Then, at Agni's (the fire god's) command, Rama realized that Sita was pure and free of any blemish. By this great act, the three worlds, including the gods, sages, and all living beings, were pleased.

84: >
  Rama, radiant and overjoyed, was honored by all the gods. His great deed brought satisfaction to the entire universe, including the celestial sages.

85: >
  Rama then crowned Vibhishana as the king of the rakshasas in Lanka. Feeling fulfilled and free of all grief, Rama rejoiced.

86: >
  After receiving a boon from the gods and reviving the Vanaras who had fallen in battle, Rama, accompanied by his friends, set out for Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana (celestial chariot).

87: >
  Reaching the ashram of Bharadwaja, the truthful and valorous Rama sent Hanuman ahead to deliver a message to Bharata.

88: >
  Conversing again with Sugriva, Rama then mounted the Pushpaka Vimana and journeyed to Nandigrama.

89: >
  At Nandigrama, the sinless Rama, along with his brothers, removed his matted locks and, after reuniting with Sita, regained his kingdom.

90: >
  The people were filled with joy, happiness, and contentment. They were prosperous, righteous, healthy, and free from disease, fear, and famine.

91: >
  No man will witness the death of his child at any time, and women will always remain faithful to their husbands, never becoming widows.

92: >
  There will be no fear of fire, and no living being will drown in water. There will be no fear from the wind, nor any suffering caused by fever.

93: >
  There will be no fear of hunger, nor will there be any fear of thieves. Cities and kingdoms will be filled with wealth and grains.

94: >
  Everyone will always be happy, just as they were during the Krita Yuga (the golden age). Rama will perform hundreds of Ashvamedha sacrifices and offer abundant gold.

95: >
  He will donate millions of cows and immense wealth to learned Brahmins in accordance with the proper rituals, earning great fame.

96: >
  Rama will establish royal dynasties that will last a hundredfold and will ensure that the four varnas (castes) follow their respective dharmas (duties).

97: >
  After ruling the kingdom for ten thousand years and another ten hundred years, Rama will ascend to Brahmaloka (the realm of Brahma).

98: >
  This sacred and sin-destroying story, which is praised by the Vedas, will free anyone who recites it from all sins.

99: >
  A person who reads this Ramayana, which bestows long life, will attain happiness in heaven after death, along with his children, grandchildren, and companions.

100: >
  By reciting this, a Brahmin will gain eloquence, a Kshatriya will attain rulership of the earth, a Vaishya will gain abundant wealth, and even a Shudra will achieve greatness.

  Thus, is the 1st chapter in the Childhood Section
  of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Narada's Narration'.
